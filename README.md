# AI-Powered Land Price Predictor 

A Machine Learning model** that predicts land prices in **different regions of India (North, South, East, West) based on land area using Linear Regression.

Features:
✅ User Input: Enter Region & Land Area to get the predicted price.  
✅ ML-Powered: Uses Linear Regression to analyze and predict prices.  
✅ One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical region data into ML-compatible format.  
✅ CSV-Based Training: Trained on sample land price data from different regions.  
✅ Scalable: Can be expanded with more real-time data for better accuracy.  

Technologies Used:
-Python
-Pandas (for data manipulation)
-NumPy (for numerical computations)
-Scikit-learn (for ML modeling)
-Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Files in the Repository:  
land_price_data.csv: Sample dataset with land prices for different regions.  
Landcostpred.py: ML script to train the model and predict land prices.
